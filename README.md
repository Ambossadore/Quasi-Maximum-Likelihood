# Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation
#### Joint Work with Jan Kallsen

This module contains the codebase for applied Quasi-Maximum Likelihood 
estimation of partially observed affine and polynomial processes. Will include:

- Methods and classes to sample consistent Quasi-Maximum Likelihood estimators
 for a given polynomial state space model
- Methods for either sampling or explicitly calculating the asymptotic covariance
 matrix of the resulting estimators.
